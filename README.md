# Snakes and Ladders 
This application is a computer version of the popular board game - snakes and ladders. 

## Description
Snakes and Ladders is a two player game. Each player rolls a dice in turn, which determines where they land next. If the player's lands at the bottom of the ladder, the token for the player will move to the top of the ladder (and thus skipping ahead). On the contrary, 
if the player's token lands at the mouth of a snake, the token will be positioned at the bottom of the snake's tail (thus falling behind). Whoever reaches the 100 grid on the board first, wins!
